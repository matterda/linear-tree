- ```criterion : {"mse", "rmse", "mae", "poisson"}, default="mse"```
    
    The function to measure the quality of a split. `"poisson"` requires `y >= 0`.
    
- ```max_depth : int, default=5```

    The maximum depth of the tree considering only the splitting nodes.
    A higher value implies a higher training time.

- ```min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=0.1```

    The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. 
    A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least `min_samples_leaf` training samples in each of the left and right branches.

    - If None or 1.0, then `max_features=n_features`.
    Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.  
  
- ```max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None```
  
    Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.

        For each datapoint x in X and for each tree in the forest, return the index of the leaf x ends up in.
        
- ```decision_path(X)```

    Return the decision path in the forest.
    
    **Parameters:**
    
    - `X` : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        
        The input samples.  
        
    **Returns:**
    
    - `indicator` : sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_nodes)
        
        Return a node indicator matrix where non zero elements indicates that the samples goes through the nodes. The matrix is of CSR format.
        
    - `n_nodes_ptr` : ndarray of shape (n_estimators + 1, )
        
        The columns from indicator[n_nodes_ptr[i]:n_nodes_ptr[i+1]] gives the indicator value for the i-th estimator.
